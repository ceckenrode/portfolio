        <h3>Fonts, Stylesheets, and Pull Requests!</h3>

            Monday night we really got into CSS in class. Shamoon explained a few concepts really well that I sort of knew, but was a little shaky on. I immediately removed the few inline styles I had on this page
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            We were also instructed to pick out and add a custom font from Google Fonts. I picked Roboto. Originally I had chosen Cinzel, which was an elegant looking serif font, maybe something you'd see on the constitution. While it was nice-looking, it wasn't very easy to read. So I went a more simplistc route and chose Roboto, a Sans-Serif font.

            Homework was to join a classmates portfolio repository in Github, create a new branch, change the color of any link to green, add, commit those changes to my new branch, and then create a pull request so than branch can be pulled into master. I was able to do that successfully after my second attempt. I think the first time I had some issues with the untidyness of my own file system on my local machine, so I cleaned that up a little today.

            Git and Github are starting to make a lot more sense now. I found some great tutorials on Githubs website and some other pages I plan on reading through later tonight so I can be more confident. I'm not too worried about that though, since it looks like we'll be using Git and Github every single class, so I'll be learning them inside and out whether I want to or not!

            <h3>Fun With CSS</h3>

                Redid the entire site design today. Played around with using divs to style the layout. Not totally sure I followed any best practices, and the page will definitely see a few more iterations. Looking forward to class tomorrow!

                Welcome to my blog! I'll make an effort to keep this up to date with relevant content about my experiences in web development. I currently am a student in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Program. Today (or I guess technically yesterday) we dove right in and started making our portfolio page using HTML and some CSS. Definitely not what I was expecting the second day of class, but I like the fast pace and our instructor Shamoon does a great job explaining concepts in a simple way. Looking forward to the next class!!!</p>

            Currently living in Rahway, New Jersey, I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for learning and solving complex problems. I'm interested in clean responsive code and helping to more easily connect people to the information they need. I want to work as a full stack developer and learn new skills while helping to build something cool!
